# Cord19-Scraper
You need to have Python3 installed in order to run the code.

Firstly, run the following line in the Command Promt / Terminal to install the necesary libraries in a new virtual environment for easier use:

virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

The metadata.cvs containing the CORD-19 data needs to be in the same directory as the main.py file.

Latest run was with the cord-19 Dataset from 2022-04-07; results are included.
